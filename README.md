# Personal Statement

Mr.Ducky (also known as Ente)  
30/08/2025  

Since 27/08/2025, I’ve experienced the most betrayal and hate I’ve ever felt on Discord, all over **one picture** I sent to 2Hell. From our very first conversation, 2Hell and I agreed not to share anything I sent. I never sent him any sources or sensitive material, just **one picture**, and he shared it anyway.  

He tried to make me betray friends I consider brothers, but I **did not betray them**. I chose to stay loyal to my friends, because I’m not betraying them for some random person I met only a month ago on Discord. Despite this, my friendship with some has still been affected. The image contained private information, yet he still made fun of it. **Don’t forget that part.**  

Without those friends, the people I truly consider brothers, I **cannot continue** anything. I quit. I quit. I quit. I don’t want to have anything to do with Roblox content or Discord anymore.  

**I’m gone. I’m gone. I’m gone.**
